[1/2] 2044 § 79 Claims from purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)  
I. Introduction  
1. Roman purchase law  
What can be referred to as Roman purchase law is a connection of elements of civil and honorary law origin, of typified business practices, and legal scholarly opinions, further developed through imperial constitutions, ultimately utilized for the Justinian legislative works. This complex has significantly evolved over the duration of the reporting period. At the center is the emptio venditio as a sales agreement, which the buyer can rely on with the actio empti and the seller with the actio venditi of the praetorian edict: Legally, the formulas proposed by the praetor in the edict formed the central basis for the enforcement of the emptio venditio as an "obligation transaction" (formula wording —Rn. 18). Additional legal bases were added, namely the aedilician edicts on the sale of slaves and beasts of burden (—Rn. 314–393) as well as later imperial constitutions.
stitutions (—Rn. 435–447). Moreover, codified law—people's laws, plebiscites, senatusconsulta—played almost no role.

In Justinian's law, all elements appear to stand on the same level, where they are meant to merge into a largely cohesive law of sale, the emptio venditio, despite their heterogeneous histories of origin.

Locating the emptio venditio within the legal layers (—§ 6; § 24 Rn. 3 ff.): The emptio venditio is traced back to the ius gentium (Paul. 33 ed. D. 18.1.1.22); this is unsurprising, as the exchange of goods for coin truly prevailed in all neighboring societies. However, the "performance obligations" arising from the emptio venditio, for which praetorian law declares the enforceability, are considered, according to the edict formulas, as those of the ius civile, since disputes concern a civil dare facere oportere established by sale or purchase. To this extent, the Praetor recognized the obligation from the sale as one of the ius civile within his jurisdiction; this will be returned to shortly (—Rn. 4).

Further legislative acts (excluding post-classical imperial edicts): edictum divi Augusti on the sale of the fundus litigiosus (circa 23 BC) —Rn. 45; prohibition of the sale of a locus religiosus pro puro (Augustus) —Rn. 74; SC Hosidianum and SC Volusianum —Rn. 61 a.E.; lex Fabia de plagiariis —Rn. 44.

For this, see Cornioley, Naturalis obligatio (1964) 112 ff.

A more technical reference is found in Marcian. [?] D. 48.22.15 pr., where the deportee, who has suffered a capitis deminuitio media, no longer participates in the ius civile but can still act according to ius gentium, such as buying and selling.

[3/4] 2045 I. Introduction
2. Prehistory

The informal purchase is the characteristic phenomenon of the monetary economy; it begins as a real-world transaction simultaneously with it. Since only Roman currency was considered for legally recognized purchases (—Rn. 86), its introduction is crucial; it is placed in the late fourth century BC. As an inherently meaningful transaction, extremely familiar to ancient life practice since the advent of coinage—not only in Rome—the exchange of goods for money, the emptio venditio (consensual purchase) gained legal recognition. This necessary reference to the transaction type "goods for money" can also be described as the purchase being not an abstract transaction but one that carries its causa—understood here as business purpose—within itself. The earliest legal significance of the emptio that has been acknowledged is likely its role as causa traditionis or usucapionis. The extent to which the validity of the emptio as causa traditionis initially depended on the payment of the purchase price for the possessed item is disputed in research due to contradictory source evidence (—§ 45, § 43 Rn. 9). The Twelve Tables clause, which stated that ownership acquisition depended on full payment or security (XII–Tab. 7,11), seems to have been mitigated in high classical times to the extent that simple crediting (even without reinforcement by a stipulation) was equated with payment (Pomp. 31 Quint. Muc. D. 18.1.19).

Presumably, the recognition of emptio and venditio as "obligatory transactions" occurred with a time delay: Due to the purchase agreement, legal action could be taken against the other party for unfulfilled performances. From the development that took place here, only the final state can be discerned without speculation, namely the formulas of the actio empti and actio venditi preserved in the edict, which can be reconstructed quite reliably (—Rn. 18). For the preceding development history, various questions need to be asked: (1) Was there legal protection for the informal purchase agreement already?
in one of the legis actiones,
and if so, was there already moderation by bona fides in this context? 
4For the prehistory of emptio venditio, see especially Gagliardi, in: Garofalo, Obbligazioni I (2007) 101–180; Cancelli, Origine (1963); Corbino, Iura 64 (2016) 9–100; for the practice of sales law as it is recognizable in Plautus, see Cristaldi, Index 39 (2011) 491–523.

[5] 2046 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)
In this case, there might have been a transition of this legal protection into the honorary legal protection according to the edict formulas. (2) At what point did the praetor first grant legal protection to the purchase agreement in the formulary procedure? (3) What instruments did legal transactions use to make purchase agreements legally binding under the older legal state, in which the informal purchase agreement did not yet form its own basis for claims? This question becomes all the more pressing the later one dates the onset of praetorian legal protection. Furthermore, it seems conceivable that the praetorian legal protection was oriented towards the practices found, which would have brought a certain continuation in the development and application of the edict formulas. (4) Is it to be assumed that the praetor peregrinus played a pioneering role in the provision of praetorian legal protection, which the praetor urbanus then adopted? (5) How is it explained that the performance obligations of buyer and seller appear as those of the ius civile, although the transaction is traced back to the ius gentium and legal protection is found on an honorary legal basis? Has there been a reception of honorary law into civil law here, or was the enforceable law of the informal emptio venditio from the beginning a part of the ius civile? This bundle of questions has repeatedly inspired the drawing of coherent development histories. Throughout, these are only judgments of probability, so that very different narratives have been developed. The questions essentially arise in the same way for the other iudicia bonae fidei, for which the research status is comprehensively reported earlier (—§ 78 Rn. 12–18). The following are only observations that specifically relate to the emptio venditio.
The origin of the emptio venditio is often discussed in terms of the cash sale.
8However, a purchase executed immediately by both parties could not, given the then absence of warranty rules, pose any problems of claimability; no obligation arose, and the emptio merely formed the causa for the acquisition. Such a transaction therefore does not provide an explanation for the development towards claimability. It is different with exchange transactions where one side performs immediately against a promise of later performance, which may have been made in stipulation form: The buyer pays immediately against a promise of future delivery;9 the buyer receives the purchased item immediately against the promise of later payment given in stipulation form. From here, the essential development step towards the legal binding of the informal purchase would be that for the given counter-obligation from the stipulation.
ulations form was disregarded. This is supported by the stipulation-like (or stipulation-similar) promise formulas in the Roman formula books (—Rn. 11), as well as the fact that purchases in legal transactions were widely accompanied by various types of securing stipulations. Initially, the development was completed as soon as the purchase agreement, which had not yet been executed by either party, was granted legal protection in both directions. For the buyer, legal protection may have depended on whether he had paid the purchase price or had promised it in stipulation form; still —Rn. 52.10 In contrast, the buyer's promise to pay, which appears to be included in the informal purchase agreement, had roughly the same effect as a payment promise given in stipulation form: The buyer must pay, not if and because he has received the item, but because he has purchased it. Perhaps this perspective is also reflected in the requirements for the certainty of the purchase price, which are of quasi-executive strictness (—Rn. 87–89). Finally, it should be mentioned Mommsen's thesis, according to which the enforceability of private purchase contracts had its model in transactions of the ius publicum; the Roman state acted both as a buyer (military supply) and as a seller (auction of booty),11 and for these transactions, certain peculiarities can indeed be identified, such as the informality and the state's obligation to "honesty."12

3. Mancipatio and emptio venditio
In Roman law, two types of sales transactions are encountered, the older mancipatio (—§1 7 6 Rn. 1–5) and the emptio venditio. Both transactions were categorically different. The ancient civil mancipatio was a formal registry act with origins in a not yet written legal culture: In the presence of witnesses, the mancipio accipiens was proclaimed to have acquired private property for consideration under Roman citizenship law. It was a real "legal transaction," as the execution of the mancipatio aimed at the private law allocation of goods. In this way, "registrable" were Italian lands, slaves, horses, cattle, donkeys, mules (res mancipi), alongside the servitus praedii rustici (—§ 50 Rn. 6).13 In contrast, the formless emptio venditio was about the delivery of any object in its tangible, natural usability; the transfer of ownership was not its immediate business purpose (—Rn. 236).14 The circle of persons to whom these transactions were open differed, as the mancipatio was reserved for citizens (—§ 26) and peregrines with the ius commercii (Ulp. reg. 19,4), whereas the emptio venditio did not have an exclusive character, as corresponds to its connection to the ius gentium.

[7] 2048 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)
The emptio venditio could always have res mancipi as a contract object. The consensual sale of res mancipi occurred to a significant extent. This was neither a type error nor a circumvention transaction. Rather, an item was simply made the object of an emptio venditio, for which there was also the fundamental possibility among Roman citizens to carry out a formal registry act. The essential main performance obligations established by the emptio venditio of the seller, to provide the buyer with the permanent actual use and application...
to grant and guarantee the purchased item (—Rn. 120–141), had to be fulfilled indiscriminately for res mancipi and res nec mancipi, precisely because it concerned the physical object in its real-world corporeality. The conclusion of an emptio venditio over a res mancipi left the possibility for Roman citizens to also mancipate it, that is, to also perform the formal "registration act," unaffected: the transactions did not exclude each other. The legal discussions of Roman jurists must have significantly addressed the questions arising from the interaction of emptio venditio with mancipatio and its consequences: (1) If a mancipatio also occurred, the payment originally integrated into this act could be "separated"; the purchase price was then paid emptionis causa—indeed, also at a different time than when the mancipatio was carried out; the mancipatio was conducted nummo uno,15 which led to certain complications, as claims from the mancipatio focused on the "weighed" quantity as consideration, i.e., the paid amount of money (mancipatio emptionis causa);—Rn. 248. (2) If a mancipatio had occurred, the buyer/acquirer subsequently had access to both the claims from the mancipatio and the actio empti: competition issues arose (—Rn. 291). (3) If a mancipatio had (not yet) occurred, the question arose whether the buyer could demand that the res mancipi be mancipated to him based on the emptio venditio (—Rn. 139). (4) If the sold res mancipi was delivered to the buyer but never mancipated, questions still arose regarding his legal position against (a) his seller and (b) the seller's heirs as well as (c) third parties; this complex is addressed under the term "bonitary ownership" (exceptio rei venditae et traditae—§ 59 Rn. 233 ff., § 39 Rn. 7; actio Publiciana—§ 63). Regarding (a), it is also relevant that in legal transactions, additional stipulations created a substitute for the specific claims that would have been available due to a mancipatio (regarding satisdatio secundum mancipium—Rn. 254–263). (5) When performing a mancipatio, sales conditions had to be integrated through leges mancipio dicta; in sales via emptio venditio, this function was taken over by stipulations or pacta (—Rn. 57–60). – The transmission situation is rather unfavorable in this respect, as the Justinian codification eliminated the mancipatio from the legal order and blurred related text and problem traces (—Rn. 450). The extended development, in which the mancipatio fell out of use, is said to have occurred in the post-classical period; details are scarcely clarified.16 In any case, one must assume that the mancipatio, as a valid legal institution, demanded the attention of jurists throughout the entire classical period. In the Fragmenta Vaticana, res mancipi and the mancipatio play a role as apparently living law (e.g., Frg. Vat. 1, 45, 47 ff.); similarly, the mancipatio is still addressed in connection with the emptio venditio in the Paulussentenzen, in which the author would have only presented what appeared to him as essential (Paul. sent. 2.17.3, with the consequences of the auctoritas liability linked to the mancipation in Paul. sent. 2.17.3 and the actio de modo agri in Paul. sent. 2.17.4).

4. Simple and Complex Sales Transactions

The emptio venditio initially had a fundamentally simple content: An object in its materiality changed ownership for money; the seller was entitled to claim the price, the buyer, that the seller
the matter in its objectivity over time. The legal traffic has adapted this essentially elementary content of the purchase transaction to the ever-changing circumstances of specific business cases. Special agreements were made, which—in today's language—included, among other things, the modalities of delivery and payment, warranties for material and legal defects, contractual penalties, the financing of the purchase price, further use of the item, and a possible dissolution of the transaction. Means for this included not only conditions but also, above all, side agreements (pacta) (—Rn. 57–58) and connected transactions with their own legal recourse, typically stipulations. A real-life purchase transaction was then no longer composed of a single legal transaction, emptio venditio, but rather a combination of several business elements. Jurists refer to a purchase concluded without additional agreements as simplaria emptio; the exact meaning is context-dependent.17

The numerous elements that were brought together in the practice of sales law were heterogeneous, as any possible mancipation and/or accompanying stipulations required corresponding formalities that were foreign to the conclusion of emptio venditio, and the respective legal recourses were also designed differently. It was the task of jurisprudence to bring the various elements—also across legal layers—into a coherent interplay (—§ 6 Rn. 163 ff.). Over a process lasting centuries, legal statements crystallized on the most diverse individual questions, which 16Nowak, JJP 41 (2011) 103–122; also —Rn. 450. 17See also —Rn. 305. Wolfgang Ernst

[10] 2050 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi) found their expression in the major edict commentaries of the second and early third centuries. In retrospect, "Roman sales law" appears as a finely differentiated legal matter that seems to have an "objective" existence, but in historical development, it emerged from the creativity of legal traffic, from the literary fixation and explanation of business forms, from the issuance of magisterial edicts, from the consideration of specific circumstances and general contractual practices by the iudices, and from the ongoing work of jurists on the matter.

5. Purposes of emptio venditio in Roman Legal Traffic
The purposes of emptio venditio spanned an exceedingly wide range of business activities. It is part of the described differentiation process that particularly the economically central turnover transactions, mentioned here are only real estate,18 slave,19 livestock, horse,20 grain, oil, and wine purchases,21 brought forth special practices and thus rules that gave these respective transactions their own character. However, there was no formation of legally independent "subtypes": In all changing application contexts, the commonality of enforcement based on one and the same formula remains. It corresponds to this that the major edict commentaries effortlessly switch between very different application contexts. For all these purposes, modern research attempts to better understand the economic side of the events;22 in doing so, the question intertwines with the search for a Roman commercial law.23

[11/12] 2051 I. Introduction
Roman writers compiled business-standard forms for practical use. Besides Cato's De Agri Cultura and Varro's De re rustica, which each also preformulate contractual regulations,24 as we learn from Cicero25 and Varro,26 Manilius authored a specifically legal work on sales (Venalium vendendorum leges), of which nothing has survived. Contractual terms were typically set by the seller; "purchase terms" likely did not exist. The surviving sales documents are extensively analyzed, particularly to see if they reflect the statements and themes of academic jurisprudence or reveal them as unrealistic. A consistent observation is that the arrangements discussed in legal literature also recur in practice. With due caution, one can say that the legal literature—much of which is also a glass bead game—provides a useful approximation for "law in action."
The number of edited sales documents is manageable.27Latin-Roman 12

Even for commercial transactions in the Roman provinces, a coexistence of traditional legal convictions ("folk laws") and Roman legal thinking is to be expected (on legal pluralism —§ 8 Rn. 49 ff.). Possibly, the parties had a kind of choice of law in the area of traffic law.
Specifically for the emptio venditio, the question arises as to what extent and with
what modifications city Roman law, especially the edict of the curule aediles, was alive in the provinces (—Rn. 315).41
6. The Position of Purchase in the Teaching Systems of Roman Jurists
The emptio venditio is counted by Gaius among the consensual contracts (—§ 24). 14
Since the purchase is referred to as contractus, the general discussion about this term42 also applies to the consensual purchase. The emptio venditio is referred to by Ulpian following Labeo – alongside locatio conductio and societas – as contractus, as
ultro citroque obligatio, which the Greeks call synallagma (Ulp. 11 ed.
D. 50.16.19).43 This statement, usually supplemented by Ulp. 4 ed. D. 2.14.7 pr.–2, has received much attention in research.44 It is already the question of whether this refers to the establishment of consensus between two interested parties (mutual obligation act) or to the fact that both contracting parties mutually obligate each other (both parties obligating each other).
Obligation); in this direction, Gai. 3.137.45 suggests further that it is not certain whether the (quite different) system concepts and contract theories that have been read into the text46 are really supported by it. The main significance of the figure seems to have been in the area of agreements for which there was no immediate legal protection, likely with the tendency to protect unnamed exchange agreements better (—§ 90 Rn. 20 ff.). In contrast, the concept of synallagma apparently played no role for the emptio venditio. Even in substance, the Roman jurists did not develop a comprehensive doctrine of reciprocity of bilateral promises of performance – what modern dogmatics calls the (genetic or functional) synallagma (—Rn. 52–53).

7. The Application of Sales Law to Other Transactions
The law of emptio venditio applied without further ado to the sale of pledges; this was carried out by the pledgee based on a pactum de vendendo concluded with the pledgor.47 The creditor secured by fiducia (—§ 88) realized the res mancipi through remunerated mancipation based on his own right; for him, a pactum de vendenda fiducia may have been involved.48 The datio in solutum was treated by some jurists like a sale; according to their view, the creditor receives the legal status regarding the thing given to him in lieu of performance equivalent to that of a buyer (school dispute).49 This idea is also picked up in imperial justice: Ant. C. 8.44.4 (a.212) affirms an eviction protection for the acquirer akin to a purchase. The quasi-acquisition of a thing by the defendant who pays the litis aestimatio is also treated as purchase-like.50 In the division judgment based on the actio communi dividundo, the judge sets a iustum pretium for the items assigned and orders an eviction stipulation in favor of the acquiring party (Paul. 23 ed. D. 10.3.10.2). In the division of land, according to Ant. C. 3.38.1 (a.229), each is to be regarded as a buyer for the part assigned to him. The sale of entire assets for enforcement purposes appears as venditio bonorum.51 On the application of sales law – or parts thereof – to barter, —Rn. 33. The manumission of slaves was a bilateral purchase-like transaction if the slave gave his owner money for his release; if the slave involved a trusted person to first buy and then release him with the slave's money, a so-called manumission mandate was present, and, in the relationship between the mandatary and the owner, a regular slave purchase in principle.52

[16/17] 2055 II. The emptio venditio in the formulary process
8. On the research history of Roman sales law
In the form in which the Justinian codification had processed Roman sales law, European jurisprudence found the foundation of sales law since the Middle Ages. From the beginning, the discovered regulations were further systematized and rationalized; these tendencies were encouraged by the Justinian presentation. Contingent-seeming individual regulations were now generalized, and the liability prerequisites (especially of the seller) were reformulated in a more understandable, abstract manner. For all the "progress" made in this direction, efforts were made for a – often quite forced – textual backing. The sales law that emerged from the handling of the Digests since the Middle Ages ultimately presents itself as a significant reformation of classical Roman law. In line with the text exegetes of the Middle Ages, modern Romanist research also tends to see these "progresses" as achievements of the late classical jurists. Thus, the sales law of the late classical period is consistently misrepresented: It appears in many details as too abstract-modern, with rational generalizations placed on new foundations. Examples include: the application breadth of the purchase, comprehensively covering every purchase of goods and rights (—Rn. 77–82), the assumption that the emptio venditio was also considered for a so-called "pure" generic purchase (—Rn. 68), the determination of interest along the lines of medieval damage categories (—Rn. 170), the supposedly general availability of the actio empti to compensate for legal and material defects (—Rn. 280–294 or Rn. 404–419), and the notion that a modern, theoretical synallagma concept had ordered the relationship of the opposing party obligations (—Rn. 52). The following will show that and how the high and late classical jurisprudence impressively refined, coordinated, and rounded off the components of Roman sales law in countless details – fundamental new approaches, with which one would have broken through to the aforementioned "design elements" of sales law, cannot, in my opinion, be attributed to late classical jurisprudence. Furthermore, it requires stronger consideration that even late classical law was significantly concerned with the legal effects of mancipatio (especially auctoritas, dicta in mancipio), which were omitted by the Justinian codification.
II. The emptio venditio in the formulary process
1. The components of the formulas in overview and interaction
The Roman sales law of emptio venditio developed in the execution of formulary procedures and with reference to these. The state of transmission is not entirely ideal here, as many details of a formulary technical nature were removed or reshaped in the Justinian codification. Nevertheless, Wolfgang Ernst

[18/19] 2056 § 79 Claims from purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)
Gaius, in his Institutions, treats formula components of purchase claims in several places in an exemplary manner, so that their reconstruction is possible with rare certainty.53 The legal understanding of the purchase relationship, as it developed on the basis of the formulary process, remained predominantly also still measurable.
eblich, after the transition to the cognition procedure had taken place. In the Julian edict (§ 3 Rn. 15 f.), the formulas for purchase are found in the XIX title "De bonae fidei iudiciis." A development of the formula is not anticipated; it likely remained unchanged from the initial establishment of the edict until the Hadrianic final redaction. A promise of legal protection from the praetor was apparently absent in the edict—at least in its form fixed under Hadrian—and could be absent since the emptio venditio was considered integrated into the ius civile (—Rn. 3).

As an example, consider the actio empti in the sale of a slave:5418

[demonstratio:]
Quod Aulus Agerius de Numerio Negidio hominem, quo de agitur emit, quia de re agitur,

[intentio:]
quidquid ob eam rem Numerius Negidius Aulo Agerio dare facere oportere ex fide bona,

[condemnatio:]
eius iudex Numerium Negidium Aulo Agerio condemnato, si non paret absolvito.

Regarding the matter that Aulus Agerius bought the slave from Numerius Negidius, which is the subject of the dispute here, whatever in this matter Numerius Negidius owes to transfer or do for Aulus Agerius in good faith, you, judge, shall condemn Numerius Negidius in favor of Aulus Agerius; if it does not prove true, you shall acquit.

The demonstratio determined the purchase agreement from which the civil obligation is supposed to arise, for which the defendant is being sued. This fixes the disputed purchase relationship, the res de qua agitur. The demonstratio also predetermined the scope of the consumption effect of the litis contestatio. The intentio of the buyer's claim refers to the civil obligation(s) of the seller that arose from the valid purchase event, as addressed in the demonstratio; similarly for the seller's claim. The intentio is civilis, in ius concepta. It is an intentio incerta.55 Due to the possible judicial concretization of the obligation(s), it is not about a binary decision of the existence or non-existence of only a single, pre-determined civil legal position. What could be required from the seller covers a wide range (dare, facere); it includes, for example, the issuance of stipulations (especially cautiones), contract annulment (Ulp. 32 ed. 53S.Ernst, FS Mayer-Maly (2002) 159–174. 54For reconstruction —§ 78 Rn. 34–40. 55Fundamentally Selb, Formulas (1974). Wolfgang Ernst

[20/22] 2057 II. The emptio venditio in the formulary process D. 19.1.11.5), the assignment of claims, the purging of the purchased item from existing liens (not only in the case of a pawn sale)56 or the return of the purchased item (—Rn. 120). For the buyer, for example, the acceptance of a lease agreement may be considered (—Rn. 424). The multifaceted dare facere oportere ex fide bona is transformed into a payment obligation in the condemnatio. While the content of the obligation, which the judex has to concretize and based on which the condemnation can then occur, was of a plastic nature, the condemnatio—as usual—was binary in design. The clause did not allow for a condemnatio ex bono et aequo. The formula thus granted "in the intentio the judge the widest conceivable discretion by allowing the examination of the basis and scope ex fide bona...; in the condemnatio, however, the formula instructed the judge to express the claim resulting from the intentio in monetary value without further alteration."57 It is not certain whether, with regard to the later quantification of the plaintiff's interest, a taxatio was possible, in which the plaintiff indicated a maximum amount, which was then—subject to praetorian correction—incorporated into the condemnatio;58 also —Rn. 160.

2. The Possible Parties
a. Requirements for Party Status

One of the parties had to be a Roman citizen; only to the extent that the actio empti or venditi was brought before the praetor urbanus was the citizenship of both parties required. The purchase by or from a pupillus sine tutoris auctoritate has occupied Roman jurists from various perspectives. In principle, the pupillus cannot be held accountable from the transaction; however, he himself acquires the contractual rights corresponding to his party role (Ulp. 32 ed. D. 19.1.13.29), which he can only enforce if he is willing to fulfill his obligations (Paul. 5 quaest. D. 18.5.7.1). The term negotium claudicans, coined with regard to Inst. 1.21 pr., is not classical. If the buyer received the purchased item from the pupillus sine tutoris auctoritate, the question arises whether he acquires it pro emptore. The sale by or to a furiosus is void (Paul. 54 ed. D. 41.4.2.16; Paul. sent. 2.17.10.).

Certain individuals were or became excluded from specific purchase transactions over the course of Roman legal development. Guardians were not allowed to purchase items from their wards (Paul. 33 ed. D. 18.1.34.7). In the case of a necessarily failed sale of a dowry property by the husband, the possibility arises that the forfeiture of the dowry upon the wife's death leads to convalescence for the husband (Pap. 3 quaest. D. 41.3.42; Marcian. 7 dig. D. 23.5.17). Other peculiarities of purchase relationships arising from the uniqueness of Roman personal law, such as the impossibility of purchase transactions between father and house son, except for res castrenses, are not further addressed here.

In the course of Roman antiquity, statutory sales prohibitions related to state administration increased; these are mentioned here only selectively and cursorily: Provincial officials may only cover necessities through purchases (Ulp. 1 off. procons.D. 1.16.6.3). Officials may not sell administrative assets (Marcian. del. sing. D. 18.1.46). Military personnel were not allowed to acquire land in their provinces (Marcian. 3 inst. D. 49.16.9 pr.).

b. Sale/Purchase by Slaves, Subjugated Persons, or Free Intermediaries

When concluding the purchase agreement, slaves can be on either the seller's or buyer's side. If a party to the purchase is a slave, the active right belongs to the dominus, while the purchase law actions were granted as adjunctive claims for his liability. If the dominus was only liable to a limited extent (e.g., dumtaxat de peculio), the opponent had to perform only upon full receipt of what was owed to him (Paul. 5 quaest. D. 21.1.57 pr.; Paul. 7 Plaut. D. 12.1.31.1). The same applied to sales by or to subjugated persons.

A free person cannot purchase for another. If someone makes a purchase simultaneously for himself and a third party, according to Iav. 11 epist. D. 18.1.64, the purchase should be upheld solely for the person acting; the intended involvement of the third party on the acquirer's side is ignored. From purchase contracts involving a business manager or captain, the contract partner might possibly use the actio...

—§ 82) an item for his principal or client, who is to pay the price and receive the item or hand over his item and receive the purchase price in return.68 The purchase transaction fundamentally takes place between the agent and his business partner, but acting on behalf of another introduces numerous peculiarities in the transaction's execution.69 For example, in a sales mandate involving res mancipi, the buyer receives bonitary ownership due to his business and the seller's authorization; he can fend off the owner's potential vindication (Ulp. 76 ed. D. 21.3.1.2).70 Ulp. 32 ed. D. 19.1.13.25 instructively discusses a sale by a procurator with an eviction guarantee. Paul. 32 ed. D. 17.1.26.7 and Afr. 8 quaest. D. 47.2.62.5 discuss the case where a slave acquired by a purchasing agent steals from him. Ulp. 4 ed. D. 2.14.16.1 addresses the situation where the owner agrees with the acquirer to take back the slave, rendering the actio venditi unenforceable for the one who sold on his behalf.
71For securing the buyer through the satisdatio secundum mancipium —Rn. 254–263. – A purchase mandate for a slave purchase also occurred in such a way that the slave himself commissioned a third party to buy him with money provided by the slave and then to free him.72
c. Multiple parties in the purchase relationship
In the process, only one person is mandatory on both the plaintiff and defendant sides. The occurrence of multiple parties on the seller and buyer sides was procedurally managed in lawsuits by individual buyers/sellers against individual sellers/buyers. Fundamentally, each party from the contract partner plurality could be sued for the entire amount (in solidum); the possibility of suing others ceased only upon receipt of performance (solution competition).73 Marcell. 6 dig. D. 19.2.47 introduces a development: As long as each of several buyers or tenants is solvent, they can limit their liability to their share of the purchase price.74 Paul. 3 ed. D. 2.14.17.5 discusses the question of individual or collective effect of exceptiones pacti. A unique form of multiple parties arises on the buyer's side when the buyer is a servus communis (see, for example, Ulp. 1 ed. aed. cur. D 21.1.31.7,8). Legal issues concerning buyer or seller multiplicity were particularly addressed in relation to liability for defects (—Rn. 334–335).75

[27/31] 2060 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)  
A plurality of persons on the seller's and buyer's side arises subsequently when the seller or the buyer dies and an heir community takes their place. The legal position established by the emptio venditio of buyer and seller is inheritable both actively and passively. Due to the principle nomina ipso iure divisa (—§5 8 Rn. 20 ff.), co-heirs of the buyer are individually liable only for the purchase price share falling to them; if one of the co-heirs sues the seller, the seller can, of course, make their performance dependent on the full payment of the purchase price (Ulp. 32 ed. D. 19.1.13.8 and Ulp. 1 ed aed. cur. D. 21.1.31.8).76  
Where an item was held in co-ownership (—§ 47), several parallel sales pro parte could occur: Each seller sells their share in a separate transaction to the same buyer;77 they are liable only for the share they sold, but joint liability of the several sellers could be contractually assumed.78 Such sales by multiple co-owners seem to have occurred particularly with real estate—possibly a reflection of previous divisions in inheritance. The Justinian Code includes five imperial constitutions on the sale of communal items under the title De communium rerum alienatione (C. 4.52).  
Regarding the trading companies of the slave economy, the societates ad emendum or vendendum certam rei —§ 81 Rn. 6. Regarding purchase or sale by universitates —§3 2 Rn. 26.  
From each side, guarantors (fideiussores) were often provided 30 (—§ 73); on the buyer's side for the payment of the purchase price (Paul. 4 epit. Dig. D. 18.1.40.2; Alf. 2 dig. D. 44.1.14; Pomp. 35 Sab. D. 46.3.26), typically on the seller's side for the case of eviction (eviction guarantors), e.g., Diocl./Maxim. C. 8.44.31 (a.294).79 The recourse to such guarantors occurred procedurally in separate proceedings (condictio or actio ex stipulatu), for which a different judge was also appointed. The question of accessory liability is addressed, for example, in the case of contract rescission in Paul. 33 ed. D. 18.5.3.

[32/33] 2061 II. The emptio venditio in the Formula Process  
In the editio actionis, the plaintiff will name the actio empti or the actio venditi. 32  
The negotiation conducted before and with the praetor included clarifying whether rights from the agreed transaction were to be asserted via an actio empti or venditi or another actio. Side agreements could lead to the business no longer qualifying as emptio venditio.81 If it was not a straightforward purchase transaction, the claim from the purchase could possibly be modified by the expansion praescriptis verbis (—Rn. 37–38); possibly, a formula set up for another contract (e.g., locatio conductio; —§ 80) was suitable; finally, it could be shifted to the area of innominate agreements (—§ 90). From borderline cases of this kind, which in many...
In order to highlight three particularly well-known instances:

The question of whether barter should be classified as emptio venditio was controversially answered by the Roman jurists. It was a matter of academic dispute, depicted by Gaius (Gai. 3.141). As this was a particularly prominent case of the contrast between the Proculians and Sabinians, the topic is thoroughly researched (§ 90 Rn. 25 ff.). The Proculians insisted that the consideration agreed upon for the item must be in money, while Sabinus and Cassius were willing to forego this requirement and allowed the barter agreement to participate in the enforceability of the sale. The argument that this would lose the ability to distinguish between price and goods was countered by Caelius Sabinus, who argued that the seller should be considered the one who offered their item for sale. Paulus deepens the Proculian position by pointing out the asymmetry in the obligations of the seller and buyer: The seller only owes the granting of habere licere, while the buyer must make the seller the owner of the paid coins (Paul. 32 ed. D. 19.4.1.1). The classification of barter, as developed based on the Proculian opinion (this is ultimately confirmed by Inst. 3.23.2), belongs to the area of innominate contracts (§ 90). This also applies to the transaction where a service is rendered in exchange for a work.

The transfer of a plot of land to a contractor, who in return will develop another plot of the giver, is denied the character of a sale by Ner. 1 resp. D. 19.5.6; with some variation, however, the transaction can be brought under the sale (Pomp. 9 Sab. D. 19.1.6.1).

If the acquirer is to receive an item that was to be manufactured by the other party, a demarcation problem arises with locatio conductio (operis) (§ 80 Rn. 58 ff.). If the material is provided by the manufacturer, it was not in doubt that one must sue ex conducto. If the material comes from the buyer, there was a difference of opinion and possibly an academic dispute: Cassius wanted to split the transaction into two contracts, one for the purchase of the material and one for a locatio conductio for the manufacturing (Gai. 3.147). The opposing view, which assumed a unified emptio venditio, prevailed and was eventually confirmed by Justinian (Inst. 3.24.4). However, where the acquisition of ownership by the buyer occurred without deliberate transfer, a locatio conductio was assumed, namely in the construction of a building on the buyer's land with the contractor's materials (Pomp. 9 Sab. D. 18.1.20) or in the repair of clothing with thread/fabric of the contractor.

A contract entered into in perpetuity for the gifting...
of municipal properties is not purchase, but locatio conductio (Gai. 3.145).88– Gaius acknowledges the possibility that a transaction can be qualified as either emptio venditio or locatio conductio depending on the occurrence or non-occurrence of a condition (Gai. 3.146: Gladiators are considered rented if they survive; purchased if they fall in battle); thus, it was not necessary to sue praescriptis verbis.89 The possibility of such an initially pending qualification may have been previously disputed.

In a significant number of cases where a sales transaction played a role, resolutions were achieved with other actiones than with the actiones empti or venditi. These lawsuits primarily originate from the area we classify today as tort law. Notably, cases where the buyer is assisted against the seller with the actio doli are to be mentioned here.

[37/38] 2063 II. The emptio venditio in the formulary process
b. Agere praescriptis verbis in purchase lawsuits
For the same purchase relationship, a series of performance obligations can successively give rise to legal pursuit through the intentio based on bona fides. This was problematic from the perspective of consumption (—§ 12 Rn. 16 f., § 13 Rn. 91): If, for instance, the buyer must file the actio empti to have the seller convicted for a very specific "non-fulfillment," he might want to keep the lawsuit open for future performances. To this end, the plaintiff used a praescriptio pro actore. Gaius describes its use as follows (Gai. 4.131a): A buyer demands the mancipation of the sold fundus with the actio empti; he may later need to demand the traditio of vacant possession (or other performances). By stating in advance that the matter concerns the mancipation of the fundus, the lawsuit is declared as a partial lawsuit and prevents the lawsuit with its incerta intentio (quidquid ob eam rem dare facere oportet ex fide bona) from having an overall consuming effect.90 Lenel suspected that the edict provided a standard praescriptio for all bonae fidei iudicia for this purpose.91

For the total sale of several items (multiple items/one total price), a similar problem arose. The transaction is understood as a unit, to which only a single actio empti (or actio venditi) corresponded. According to a report by Gaius (Gai. 4.59), Labeo and other jurists approved a lawsuit for only one of two items in a cumulative sale, which should not preclude the later filing of another lawsuit for the second item. This was achieved by naming only one of the items in the demonstratio; a praescriptio pro actore was unnecessary in this approach.92 Thus, both the formulation of the demonstratio and the formulation of the praescriptis verbis were fundamentally considered for limiting the subject matter of the dispute. This was different from the stipulation, for which, according to Ulp. 46 Sab. D. 45.1.29, the principle tot stipulationes quot res applied: for each item, a separate condictio/actio ex stipulatu was available (—§ 21 Rn. 11). Despite the limitation of the lawsuit to one of the items, the fact that it was a
Total sale must be considered: In cases of defects affecting one of the purchased items, the question arose whether a comprehensive view should be taken, so that, for example, the smaller size of one property is compensated by a larger than agreed area of the other property, or whether the defect gives the buyer rights regardless of the other purchased item (Paul. 2 90S. also Artner, Agere praescriptis verbis (2002) 57 ff., 63 f. with references. 91Lenel, EP 154 f. 92Ulp. 23 ed. D. 19.1.33 is sometimes taken as confirmation, but this fragment certainly only shows the occurrence of the sale of several items for a total price; see Staffhorst, Partial Invalidity (2006) 277, 278 Fn. 44. Wolfgang Ernst

[39] 2064 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi) quaest D. 19.1.42).93 The joint sale of several items mainly raised problems regarding the determination of interest94 and the aedilician edict; see Afr. 6 quaest. D. 21.1.34.1; Ulp. 2 ed. aed. cur. D. 21.1.38.14 and see —Rn. 323, Rn. 400. The several items can, but do not have to "belong together" and form a so-called "total item," a corpus ex distantibus (example: the quadriga).95 The possibility of enforcing the content of pacta with the actions for emptio venditio 39 was not unlimited (on the legal enforcement of supplementary pacta —Rn. 59). Was there a clear boundary between such contractual agreements that could still be considered within the framework of the bona fides clause of the demonstratio, and such arrangements that could only be asserted based on a formula extension praescriptis verbis?96 It seems reasonable to attribute decisive importance to the fact that the emptio venditio was granted enforceability as a standard transaction, whose significance is readily apparent to everyone. This must also have applied to the ancillary agreements known in business transactions (lex commissoria, in diem addictio, etc.). Where it was no longer about interpreting such a standard transaction, where thus the traffic view did not provide an assessment, but a unique transaction formed the basis, the scope of the direct actions empti and venditi was left. This will have particularly applied in cases where doubts arose regarding the demonstratio, whether it was really sold or bought in the sense of the edict.97 The reliance on the bona fide owed thus acted both as a driving force for innovation and as its limitation, insofar as only what was customary in transactions could be considered. Due to the elasticity of the actions empti and venditi, the boundary will have been movable. 93Schmidt-Ott, Pauli Quaestiones (1993) 40–45, with partially too far-reaching interpolation assumptions. 94Tafaro, Labeo 19 (1973) 31–41. 95Mayer-Maly, Est. d’Ors II 853–867; see also Daubermann, Totality of Items (1993). 96Staffhorst, Partial Invalidity (2006) 276 and often, counts on a far-reaching interchangeability and also with an occasional coexistence of a formula entry praescriptis verbis and a simultaneous concretization of the demonstratio in the same case; also —§ 90 Rn. 15 ff. 97Ulp. 11 ed. D. 18.1.50 deals with the purchase of a library on the condition that the city sells a property (for its installation). The condition does not occur due to the buyer. Labeo affirmed an actio praescriptis verbis, while Ulpian advocated the direct applicability of the actio venditi, perhaps due to a fiction of the condition being treacherously prevented. Artner, Agere praescriptis verbis (2002) 71–78, assumes the formula-technical isolation of the condition praescriptis verbis here; see also Thomas, RIDA326 (1979) 418 f.; further Behrends, St. Labruna I 361–385; also Pennitz, Periculum (2000).

[40/41] 2065 II. The Emptio Venditio in the Formula Process
c. Exceptiones
The question of whether the judex could consider objections in a procedure with intentio certa only through exceptio within his discretion, without an exceptio being inserted into the formula in iure, has long been disputed.98 The topic is discussed under the keyword of the inherence of the exceptio doli (generalis) (—§ 107 Rn. 10, § 106 Rn. 6 ff.). For the classical period, it is assumed that the judge could base the absolution on a plaintiff's dolus even without an inserted exceptio doli. Whether the oportere was denied in view of the plaintiff's dolus (h.M.)99 or whether the judex based his absolution on the officium iudicis despite affirming the civil oportere, as Lenel assumed,100 is left undecided here. In any case, the judex was "considered authorized to consider a praetorian ground for absolution even without a praetorian instruction."101 It is not implausible to assume that the exceptio doli was dispensable in cases where the plaintiff was accused of violating the general standard of honest seller or buyer behavior, whereas a breach of trust arising situationally from a special constellation beyond the standard purchase relationship could only be considered by the judex due to an inserted exceptio doli.102 The dolus abesse stipulation (cautio de dolo) had a different effect, as it enabled a counterclaim ex stipulatu; its use indicates a legal state in which a dolus could not easily invalidate claims from the purchase.103
Inherence is also assumed for the exceptio pacti, but this assumption has been disputed (Grosso) (details —§ 107 Rn. 8). Here, the point is made that the pactum is agreed upon: bona fides exigit, ut quod convenit fiat (Iav. 11 epist. D. 19.2.21). The effectiveness of the exceptio would therefore have been based on the corresponding, pactum-compliant interpretation of the oportere. Whether the defendant could also prudently expand the formula with an exceptio pacti is another question that is probably not clearly decidable.104 The defense-based invalidation of a claim was also possible insofar as the claim itself relied on an attached pactum (—Rn. 57–59); see especially Ulp. 32 Sab. D. 24.1.5.5 for the invalidation of a pactum understood as a price reduction using the exceptio legis Cinciae. It is repeatedly stated that in bonae fidei iudicium, the exceptio has an effect ipso iure, as for the purchase in Iul. 3 Urs. Fer. D. 19.1.28: This phrasing is best understood to mean that one was not dependent on the praetor, who thus did not have to intervene by denegatio actionis (—Rn. 43–45) or by inserting an exceptio.105
The inherence solution was only considered for such exceptions.
which the 42
objection implies that the plaintiff's request may be dismissed by the judge even without
explicit authorization by the praetor. This would have been the case with
the exceptiones doli, metus106 and pacti. For all other exceptions,
it is assumed that a corresponding formal insertion was required.107

d. Denegatio actionis in purchase claims
The possibility of a denegatio actionis (—§ 12 Rn. 5) as a result of the proceedings in 43
iure also existed for purchase claims. It is questionable whether and under what conditions
(and with what legal consequences) the denegatio actionis – beyond cases of missing
procedural prerequisites – could lead to the conclusion of the proceedings already in iure.
The exact scope of the praetorian cognition and decision-making power
is disputed in procedural law literature; this dispute is also related to the
fundamental idea of the development of the process
division into two procedural stages.108 Some assume that the
demonstratio in the early days of the formulary procedure could only refer to a legal situation that was undisputed between the parties
and/or established by the praetor with effect against them,109 from which the iudex had to proceed. Be that as it may,
the fully developed formulary process at least presents in the demonstratio an as yet unproven party assertion, the correctness or incorrectness of which is only determined apud
iudicem. The actiones empti and venditi were also not accompanied by a
causa cognitio reservation, which is why the praetorian cognition could only have played a minor role in the classical formulary process. The
praetor would have denied the "suitability for trial" if he could determine without further evidence
that the plaintiff's request was unfounded;110 in this respect

Wolfgang Ernst

[44] 2067 II. The emptio venditio in the formulary process
a remnant of "substantive" cognition and decision-making authority
would have persisted. In the words of Friedrich Ludwig Kellers: Denegatio actionis "occurs when the plaintiff's presentation appears under no aspect as significant, i.e.,
suitable for bringing about a condemnation or the like, in other words, when it neither fits an existing formula nor is worth adapting a new
or old formula to it; or when the significance it would have in itself is nullified by an objection that is not only significant but also already
liquid."111
A legal violation associated with the sale would likely have led to a denegatio actionis 44
A clear separation of legal violations, which as such were always dealt with in the cognition power of the praetor, from those over which
a hearing before the judge could/must still take place, seems hardly possible given our current knowledge. Kaser assumed that the praetor reacted with a denegatio actionis if the transaction involved a clear legal violation, both in so-called perfect and imperfect prohibitive laws. In the case of a lex imperfecta, where determining whether the prohibition was fulfilled required a thorough examination, Kaser assumed that an exceptio would be inserted and thus the examination referred to the judge;
112 however, this seems to be secured only for claims from stipulation. Regarding sales between spouses "to
Friendship price", which today is referred to as a mixed donation, was opposed by the lex Cincia. According to Ulpian, it was nullius momenti:113 Should one conclude from this phrase that a denegatio actionis had to take place? Perhaps one may consider the case where both buyer and seller knowingly contracted over a res furtiva (stolen item) (Paul. 33 ed. D. 18.1.34.3)? The republican lex Fabia de plagiariis prohibited, among other things, the purchase and sale of a fugitive slave under threat of a mutual monetary penalty (Paul. sent. 1.6a.2). Jurists often address the effect of legal prohibitions on purchase only indirectly by discussing the buyer's legal position against in rem claims.114 This is the case with the sale of a pledged item that a woman gave to her creditor contrary to the SC Velleianum (—§ 29 Rn. 27) (Ulp. 17 ed. D. 6.1.39.1 [Julian] with Gai. 7 ed. prov. D. 6.1.40). In the sale of a praedium dotale contrary to the law of the lex Iulia (—§ 35 Rn. 154), the property was treated similarly to a res furtiva (Pap. 3 quaest. D. 41.3.42).115 It may have been similar when the object of a prohibited spousal gift was resold by the gifted spouse. Subsequently, the buyer lost the possibility of usucapion if the selling magistrate had gifted the item contra legem repetundarum (Paul. 7 Plaut. D. 41.1.48 pr.). The loss of the possibility of usucapion meant for the seller that he remained indefinitely exposed to an eviction recourse. Guardians were not allowed to purchase ward property (Paul. 33 ed. D. 18.1.34.7; Ulp. 40 Sab. D. 26.8.5.2–4).116 In the aforementioned cases, it is less about orders of complete nullity of the purchase contract emptio venditio, but rather about alienation prohibitions that had a real effect on consensual purchases by denying the specific purchase agreement the quality of a iusta causa (emptionis). It is not inconceivable that such alienation prohibitions were initially disregarded in the judicial enforcement of purchase obligations.117 In view of the multiple documented granting of the actio empti to the buyer in cases of the sale of homo liber, res sacra, or publica (—Rn. 73–76), it should be noted that any denegatio actionis occurred unilaterally only for the filed claim, thus not necessarily affecting the possibility of a counterclaim by the other party.

A scenario where – at least since Augustus – a denegatio actionis can be expected is the sale of a fundus litigiosus.118 The acquisition of a disputed fundus Italicus (not: res per se) from the non-possessing/claiming party by a bad-faith buyer was penalized with a monetary fine in an edictum divi Augusti (around 23 BC); in addition, the invalidity of the purchase was declared.119 According to Gai. 4.117a, the sciens emptor, who presumably acquired through mancipation, was prevented by an exceptio from reclaiming the item from the (again sued) possessor with vindication; similarly, Ulp. 76 ed. D. 44.6.1.1 (later known as exceptio rei litigiosae). It is assumed that it concerned the claims of proscribed individuals (or their heirs) who, exhausted by long litigation, were willing to sell to speculators below value; owners interested in clarifying the legal situation had to engage in ever-new lawsuits. The counteraction due to the edict should be considered if...
Imagine it like this: A files a rei vindicatio against B for an Italic property possessed by B, then A mancipates it to C, who is aware of the lawsuit. The exceptio edicti divi Augusti prevents C from suing B with the rei vindicatio. At the time of the judgment, A is no longer the owner and must lose his case. A new lawsuit by C might be opposed by the exceptio rei iudicatae. C should be deterred from starting a second lawsuit. Restrictions on purchases imposed on provincial officials and military personnel are not depicted here.

[46] 2069 II. The emptio venditio in the formulary process
In the provincial cognition process, the extension to the fundus provincialis may have had a stricter effect by depriving the traditional acquisition of ownership of the necessary causa due to the invalidity of the emptio venditio; to that extent, the disposition may have lost its effectiveness. A comprehensive justice edict by Constantine included, among other things, a provision that generally prohibits the transfer (for whatever reason) of disputed items; Const. Cod. Theod. 4.5.1 pr. (a.331). The knowledge of the acquirer is not mentioned as a requirement. As a legal consequence, it is stated that the ongoing process can continue, which will be understood as a declaration of the transfer's invalidity. Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius extend the scope into inheritance law; Grat./Valentin./Theodos. C. 8.36.3 (a.380). Under Justinian, the vitium litigiosi contractus is confirmed with the invalidity of the transfer and extended to the transfer of pending actions; Iust. C. 8.36.5 (a.532). The Codex and Digests each contain a separate title De Litigiosis (D. 44,6; C. 8.36). Finally, Nov. 112.1 (Iust. a.541) sought to clarify further questions of doubt.

e. The conditional sale in the formulary process
For the emptio venditio, the use of the condition (condicio) is discussed in various respects. The unconditional sale is referred to as emptio pura (e.g., Ulp. 28 Sab. D. 18.2.2. pr). These were suspensive conditions. As Werner Flume has particularly elaborated, in the conception of Roman jurists, a transaction agreed upon under a suspensive condition was not yet concluded in the legal sense as long as the condition had not occurred. With Ulpian's words: condicionales …venditiones tunc perficiuntur, cum impleta fuerit condicio; Ulp. 28 Sab. D. 18.1.7 pr. (Sale of a slave under the condition that he accounts to the seller/owner). As long as the condition had not occurred, the demonstratio had to go into the void, and there could be no fulfillment of the intentio and no condemnation. According to Paul. 1 ed. aed. cur. D. 21.1.43.9 i.f., it is ensured that filing a lawsuit before the condition's occurrence had no consumptive effect. Disputes about whether a condition was agreed upon at all, whether an agreed condition had occurred, or whether the occurrence of a condition was thwarted, likely came before the Judex; it is not unthinkable that the examination of the condition was prescribed to the Judex praescriptis verbis.

[47/49] 2070 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)
The legal situation pendente condicione gave rise to various questions. The guiding principle likely consisted in the fact that a purchase contract only comes into legal existence upon the occurrence of the condition. The conditional purchase contract was pendente condicione neither a causa traditionis nor usucapionis (Ulp. 28 Sab. D. 18.2.4 pr.).125
f. Instrumenta edere
Finally, the plaintiff – buyer or seller – will present those documents of evidence that he wishes to use in iudicio (instrumenta edere).126 From the instrumenta presented in iure (or from the absence of such), it may emerge that the plaintiff will not be able to prove the sale. This may have especially occurred in the case of an oral contract conclusion. Here it was possible for the defendant to confirm the conclusion of the contract in an oath (iusiurandum), to which the Judex was then bound.127 This essentially acknowledges the contract conclusion, putting it beyond dispute. Ulpian addresses the question of whether such an oath of confirmation given by the seller simultaneously constitutes a basis for the opposing seller's claim for (remaining) purchase price payment (Ulp. 22 ed. D. 12.2.13.3). Other passages speak of a pactio litigatorum (Gai. 5 ed. prov. D. 12.2.1). Whether a denegatio actionis occurred in the case of evident hopelessness of later proof is not certain.
4. Apud iudicem
Apud iudicem, both the purchase agreement designated in the demonstratio and the resulting obligation(s) could be disputed and evidence gathered, as well as the condemnation amount. Strictly speaking, the purchase agreement is only treated in its significance for the demonstratio in the limitation resulting from the contractually necessary content – it must simply be "sold" –, while further purchase agreements relating to the scope of performance were only to be addressed in relation to the intentio.128 Whether such a stratification actually occurred apud iudicem is not certain. The thesis is hardly provable,129 that in an early phase of the formulary process, the engagement with the intentio by the Judex was exhausted in a monetary estimation.130

[50/52] 2071 II. The emptio venditio in the Formulary Process
Although the formula contained no arbitration clause, the Judex would still – due to the bona fides clause and/or legitimized by the officium iudicis – have considered performances up to the judgment, as it was – likely regardless of the related school dispute (Gai. 4.114) – about an iudicium absolutorium. It is assumed that the judicial investigation of what is to be performed ex fide bona was accompanied by an interaction with the parties, and that they might ideally already agree on a settlement, which then avoids a condemnation (conciliation idea).131 To a considerable extent, the submission of stipulations apud iudicem is also to be expected.
For the procedure apud iudicem, it should only be noted here that the form...

the purchase agreement reflected in an evidence-free manner (—§ 13 Rn. 39 ff.). The
parties were, however, limited to such evidence that they had presented in iure
(Ulp. 4 ed. D. 2.13.1.3).

5. Interrelation of actio empti and actio venditi
The relationship between the actiones empti and venditi is best captured as "independence of 52
actions." Filing one of the lawsuits did not lead to a iudicium duplex
(as in partition lawsuits), for which the intentio must already refer to the mutually owed
obligations.132 From the outset, a counterclaim would have been possible according to general principles, so that the two, in themselves separate claim formulas, at least came before the same iudex after separate litis contestations.133 The possibility of a counterclaim was indeed likely utilized; this is evidenced by the repeated engagement of imperial jurisprudence with the counterclaim in the "mutual contract" (—Rn. 452). Was there also a mechanism by which the judgment or the execution of the judgment debt was made dependent on the performance of the counter-performance (exceptio non adimpleti contractus)? The question is affirmed in the literature.134 Anachronistically, the term "functional synallagma" is often used. According to the author's conviction, there was no general mechanism of this kind in the formulary process.135 When proceeding from a contract that was still unfulfilled by both parties, the situation of the seller and buyer differed: The seller was only threatened with a judgment for the

[50/52] 2072 § 79 Claims from Purchase (actio empti, actio venditi)
buyer's interest, against which he could deduct the purchase price by way of compensation.
Only in special cases, where the seller had no enforceable claim to the (entire) purchase price, was the purchased item considered as pignoris loco (quasi pignus) in his favor, aiming for full purchase price payment: For instance, if the buyer was liable only with the restriction dumtaxat de peculio (Paul. 5 quaest. D. 21.1.57 pr.; Paul. 7 Plaut. D. 12.1.31.1), if the seller in the case of negotium claudicans (—Rn. 23) had no possibility of a lawsuit for the purchase price (Paul. 5 quaest. D. 18.5.7.1), or if he had to pursue the purchase price payment in fractions in multiple processes against the buyer's heirs (Ulp. 32 ed. D. 19.1.13.8 and Ulp. 1 ed. aed. cur. D. 21.1.31.8). Scaev. 2 resp. D. 18.4.22 grants the seller, who was only partially paid, a lien-like right of retention on individual estate items. A retentio is also mentioned (Paul. 5 quaest. D. 18.5.7.1).136 The aforementioned legal statements would hardly be understandable if every unpaid seller had an inherent exceptio non adimpleti contractus. The unpaid seller does not have to tolerate an unauthorized removal of the item by the buyer; rather, he can use the actio furti against this (Ulp. 29 Sab. D. 47.2.14.1). In this respect, the possession of the item by the seller acts as a natural security measure for him. Finally, a connection can be made to the fact that for the establishment of the causa emptionis as the basis for the acquisition of ownership, the payment of the purchase price was required (—§ 43 Rn. 9; § 45).
Additionally, according to the view represented here, the situation of the buyer was different: The buyer had to accept a judgment for the purchase price, even if they had not yet received the item. Given the generic nature of the payment obligation, the buyer lacks an object capable of retention. The edictal exceptio mercis non traditae pertained to a special constellation; it was not directed against the actio venditi but against the condictio certae pecuniae when the purchaser had promised payment in the form of a stipulation to the argentarius, who had auctioned the item for the consignor: Here, the buyer had to be protected against claims from the stipulation if they did not receive the item from the consignor (—Rn. 85). To properly classify the legal position of the buyer, it must be considered that they have already purchased and, for example, are already entitled to the benefits from the purchased item (—Rn. 134–138). The unconditional payment obligation of the buyer does not appear as an unfair "pre-performance obligation." The apparently asymmetric treatment of seller and buyer (lack of parity) excludes, in my opinion, that the Roman jurists considered the reciprocal performance obligations as a theoretical concept like the "functional synallagma," which should be characterized by symmetry. Such is not expressed in any of the classical texts. Due to the possibility of set-off —§ 111.

6. Accompanying stipulationes, dicta, and pacta
a. Accompanying Stipulations
When supplementing the purchase agreement with stipulations, these had to be concluded in the proper form (—§ 21 Rn. 6 ff.). Wherever the stipulation absorbs the otherwise informal purchase consensus, the actual freedom of form of the consensual purchase (—Rn. 90) becomes meaningless. The post-classical development towards the written form of stipulation also affects the stipulations attached to the purchase. – The buyer (or the seller) pursued their potential rights from the stipulation via a condictio or an actio ex stipulatu. This led to competition problems with the actio empti or the actio venditi. In the formulary process, the two concurrent claims were initiated separately and decided by different judges. The claims could also have been raised at different times; a sequence, such as first having to litigate the stipulation, was not mandatorily prescribed. Iul. 3 Urs. Fer. D. 19.1.28 deals with a penalty promise concerning a (not specified in the text) buyer behavior that the buyer had promised to the seller, who could therefore claim it ex fide bona from the sale: After successfully litigating the stipulation, the actio venditi can only be raised for the amount by which the interest exceeds the obtained penalty. The judge, based on the officium iudicis, would have reduced the condemnatio in the actio venditi; the praetor did not have to create a basis for this (ipso iure – effect of judicial consumption). The action from the purchase thus became a claim for additional payment (Liebs). According to Julian, however, it is also possible to first sue from the purchase, whereby the judgment is apparently rendered without regard to the stipulation; the later claim from the stipulation can be opposed by the exceptio doli, insofar as the penalty amount (or more) has already been obtained ex vendito. The relationship of the claims will

D. 19.1.28 should have generally applied to stipulations for eviction protection
(—Rn. 291, 292) and stipulations for warranty against defects (—Rn. 393, 411).
b. Leges in mancipio dictae
Whenever a res mancipi was mancipated (whether for purchase or for another purpose), legally effective declarations could be made by the parties involved. The question of which categories of such declarations existed (nuncupationes/dicta in mancipio/leges mancipii) and how they might have differed is not addressed here (but —§ 19 Rn. 9).142 These leges dictae were diverse in content. A strict numerus clausus likely did not exist, but they all had a necessary relation to one of the legal effects of mancipatio: By modifying the legal effect of the specific mancipatio, it is adapted to the business intentions of the parties. If the acquisition process was to be shaped by establishing other rights/duties, accompanying stipulations had to be added. Certain leges dictae were apparently customary and thus appear as standardized. If it is true that mancipatio continued to be used in late classical times and related legal questions occupied jurists, then the leges in mancipio dictae likely still played a significant role.
The individual leges in mancipio dictae are presented in more detail in the respective context; here, an overview should suffice: In the case of land purchase, a complete and correct announcement of all rights encumbering the property was possibly expected; somewhat akin to a modern "land registry extract."143 The announcement made in the nuncupatio uti optimus maximusque sit promised the complete freedom of the sold property from servitudes; this corresponds roughly to the declaration that there is a "clean land registry sheet."144 Regarding third-party rights that the Man-

Since mancipatio also occurred for purposes other than commercial transactions, such nuncupationes could also appear in other contexts, notably (and perhaps first) in the mancipation will (—§ 17 Rn. 9, § 18 Rn. 1); see Wimmer, FS Hausmaninger 341–356.
143 Mod. 5 resp. D. 19.1.39 refers to the veteres in this regard; Cic. off. 3.16.65: Ac de iure quidem praediorum sanctum apud nos est iure civili, ut in iis vendendis vitia dicerentur, quae nota essent venditori … For the seller's liability mentioned by Cicero, it is disputed whether it relates to the actio empti or the actio auctoritatis or another (unknown to us) legal remedy linked to mancipation; see Backhaus, FS Laufs 12 Fn. 40 with references.
144 This assurance is treated in Cels. 8 dig. D. 18.1.59, Ner. 6 membr. D. 21.2.48 and Ven. 16 stip. D. 21.2.48 as well as Proc. 6 epist. D. 50.16.126. These texts might originally have dealt with a lex mancipationis (dictum in mancipio); the clause may later also have appeared in stipulations that secured the land buyer. Regarding the related ex empto liability —

[54/55] 2075 II. The Emptio Venditio in the Formula Process
If the zipant had correctly announced something, he could not be held liable later; the announcement acts like a disclaimer. The mancipant could reserve for himself the usus fructus (—§ 49)145 or servitudes (—§ 50), the latter also in favor of a neighbor (doubts addressed by Iav. 2 epist. D. 8.4.5).146 A mancipation with a declared reservation of the superficies was not possible (Paul. 74 ed. praet. D. 44.7.44.1 i. f.).147 Furthermore, in the purchase of land, a specific area could be promised through dictum; if this specification was incorrect, the buyer had access to the actio de modo agri tailored for this purpose (—Rn. 296–299). In the mancipation of slaves, it had to be announced if the slave to be mancipated had already been conditionally freed (—Rn. 246). Often, the buyer was given instructions for further dealings with the slave: He received the slave mancipated, ut manumittatur, ne manumittatur, ut exportetur (= ne in Roma/Italia esset), ne serva prostituatur. These leges dictae had "real" effects, as a violation entitled the seller to manus iniectio, which apparently led to reacquisition. It can be assumed that such leges dictae generally had effects even against subsequent buyers (—Rn. 426–434). Through dicta, it could also be promised that another item should be added to the mancipated thing: With a piece of land, operational accessories or a slave could be included, with a slave a peculium (—Rn. 132). – If it turned out that the legal situation related to the item did not correspond to what was established with the specific mancipatio, specific ancient civil legal remedies were available to the buyer or the mancipant (actio de modo agri, actio auctoritatis, manus iniectio); the parties were not reliant on the actio empti or the actio venditi in this regard. Besides these legal remedies, the actio empti (or for the seller, the actio venditi) likely served as a claim for additional demands, as was the case when coinciding with claims from the stipulation (—Rn. 53). – Finally, it has been questioned whether in the nuncupatio, quality specifications of any kind could be made, which would imply an early form of liability for defects. A presumption in this direction is no longer supported in research:148 Leges dictae always related to the ancient civil consequences of mancipation, and mancipation was – as far as we know – not associated with its own legal mechanism to respond to incorrect quality promises. However, the aedilician edict then gave the buyer, against whom a quality dictum had been made in mancipio, the right to rescind if the quality promise was not met (—Rn. 370). Late classical jurists held the seller liable through the actio empti for dolus if he had made a dictum concerning the quality of the item knowing it was incorrect (—Rn. 399). A mancipation reference was apparently no longer required for this. The transmission situation is unfavorable because the Justinianic redaction has removed the mancipatio from the texts (—Rn. 7, 450) and therefore could not continue the nuncupationes related to its specific legal consequences as such. It can be assumed that questions of leges mancipio dictae were transformed into equivalent pacta adiecta.
The right to manus iniectio was described, possibly as a contractually stipulated abducendi potestas, etc. Any dispute over the fulfillment of the promised could now be exclusively resolved through the actiones empti or venditi.149 However, the Justinian blurring of the original dicta in mancipio and their mechanisms of action was preceded by a development in classical times, during which the actio empti was used to enforce seller-side dicta, at least in cases of dolus (—Rn. 399, Rn. 414–416). In the case of slave and draft animal purchases, an incorrect dictum entitled the buyer to proceed according to the aedilician edict (—Rn. 369–374). Regarding side agreements in the slave trade, the legal situation was restructured by late and post-classical imperial constitutions (—Rn. 426–427, 429–430). Historically, the displacement or overlaying of older, mancipation-based mechanisms by newer legal elements remains fraught with uncertainties.

c. Pacta as "Side Agreements" to the Purchase
aa. The Law of pacta adiecta
In the context of a purchase transaction, the parties often make additional agreements.57 These are usually referred to as "side agreements to the purchase."150 The procedural enforceability of the pactum was fundamentally achieved through the actio empti or venditi (so-called pacta adiecta), at least when the specific pactum was customary, allowing its assessment ex fide bona; highly individualized contract designs may have required a praescriptis verbis lawsuit (—Rn. 39). The mode of action depended on the content of the pactum and its timing of conclusion (in continenti – ex intervallo): For agreements that limited the typical obligation content of the transaction (pacta ad minuendam obligationem), the question of the inherence of the exceptio pacti arises (—§ 107 Rn. 8). As far as such agreements were made simultaneously with the purchase agreement, they merged with the other (standard) content of the contractual obligations (Ulp. 4 ed. D. 2.14.7.5). Agreements that expanded the obligation content of the parties (later called pacta ad augendam obligationem) required a different and differentiated treatment: As far as they were concluded together with the purchase contract (in continenti), the typicality of the transaction initially resisted an expansion of the obligation program on the buyer's side, insofar as the required determination of a fixed monetary amount was questioned. This position was relaxed: Pomponius advocated the actio venditi for the additional promise of a construction service alongside the price payment (Pomp. 9 ad Sab. D. 19.1.6.1). The buyer's promise to adhere to a lease agreement concluded with the seller was already addressed by Servius Sulpicius and Tubero and ultimately the enforceability through an ex vendito lawsuit was recognized (Ulp. 32 ed. D. 19.1.13.30); Alex. C. 4.65.9 (a.234)151 confirms this and notes that no written form is required. A constitution of Gordian allows the (obligation-increasing) agreement of default interest on the purchase price from a certain date; Gord. C. 4.54.5 (o.A.).152 Hermogenian finally brings a generalization by recognizing the claimability with the actio empti, initially specifically for a buyer's promise of re-leasing to the seller or the restriction of resale.
